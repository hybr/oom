# Rules Directory

This directory contains **rules and reference documentation** for system design and development standards.

## Purpose

Rules files define:
- **Standards** - Naming conventions, file structures, patterns
- **Architecture** - System design, data models, workflows
- **Quick References** - Cheat sheets and templates
- **Technical Specifications** - API contracts, data types, constraints

## Rules vs Guides

### 📏 Rules (This Directory: `/rules`)

**Purpose:** Standards, conventions, and architecture references

**Audience:** Developers building new features

**Content:**
- What naming conventions to follow
- How to structure metadata files
- What patterns to use
- Architecture diagrams
- Technical specifications

**Examples:**
- "Entity IDs must be UUIDs"
- "File naming: `NNN-domain_name.sql`"
- "Process nodes have 6 types: START, TASK, DECISION, FORK, JOIN, END"

### 📚 Guides (Directory: `/guides`)

**Purpose:** Step-by-step tutorials and complete documentation

**Audience:** Users, administrators, and developers implementing features

**Content:**
- How to install the system
- How to create a vacancy workflow
- How to run migrations
- Usage examples with code
- Troubleshooting guides

**Examples:**
- "Step 1: Install process flow system..."
- "To start a process, call POST /api/process/start.php..."
- "If you get error X, try Y..."

## Quick Navigation

### Need to understand system architecture?
**→ Read:** `/rules` files

### Need to implement a feature?
**→ Read:** `/guides` files

### Need both?
**→ Start with:** `/rules` for architecture understanding
**→ Then read:** `/guides` for implementation steps

## When to Create New Rules Files

Create a new rules file when:
1. **Introducing a new system component** with its own architecture
2. **Defining standards** that apply across multiple features
3. **Documenting technical specifications** that developers need to reference

### Template for New Rules Files

```markdown
# [Component Name] - Rules and Architecture

> **📚 Note:** This is a rules reference. For implementation guides, see the `/guides` folder.

## Overview
[Brief description of the component and its purpose]

## Architecture
[System design, data models, workflow diagrams]

## Rules and Conventions
[Standards developers must follow]

## Quick Reference
[Cheat sheet of common patterns]
```

---

## Maintenance

### Updating Rules Files

**When:** System architecture changes or new standards are adopted

**Process:**
1. Update the rules file with new standards
2. Add changelog note at the top
3. Update related guides in `/guides` folder
4. Notify team of changes

### Version Control

Rules files are version-controlled in git:
- Commit rules changes separately from code
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Tag major architecture changes
