## Why "Popular" Organization Structure?

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Reusable Templates:** Organizations don't reinvent the wheel
- **Standardization:** Common industry-standard positions
- **Multi-Tenant:** Multiple organizations can reference same positions
- **Extensible:** Organizations can add custom positions

**vs. Organization-Specific Structure:**
```
‚ùå Each organization defines "Senior Developer" separately
   ‚Üí Redundant data
   ‚Üí Inconsistent naming
   ‚Üí Hard to compare across organizations

‚úÖ Use POPULAR_ORGANIZATION_POSITION
   ‚Üí Single source of truth
   ‚Üí Consistent naming
   ‚Üí Easy cross-organization analytics
   ‚Üí Organizations can still add custom positions if needed
```

---

## Position Resolution Chain

The system uses this hierarchy to resolve who can do what:

```
1. PERSON (Who)
   ‚Üì
2. EMPLOYMENT_CONTRACT (Their job)
   ‚Üì
3. POPULAR_ORGANIZATION_POSITION (Their position)
   ‚Üì
4. ENTITY_PERMISSION_DEFINITION (What they can do)
   ‚Üì
5. PROCESS_NODE (Tasks they can be assigned)
```

**Example:**
```
John Smith (PERSON)
  ‚Üí Employment Contract #12345
      ‚Üí Position: "Senior Backend Developer"
          ‚Üí Has permission: APPROVER on ORGANIZATION_VACANCY
          ‚Üí Can be assigned: "HR Review" tasks in vacancy creation process
```

    pos.code,
    dept.name as department,
    team.name as team,
    desig.name as designation,

## Creating New Positions

### Pattern: Build from Components
```sql
-- Step 1: Find department
SELECT id FROM popular_organization_departments
WHERE code = 'ENG';

-- Step 2: Find team (optional)
SELECT id FROM popular_organization_department_teams
WHERE department_id = ? AND code = 'BACKEND';

-- Step 3: Find designation
SELECT id FROM popular_organization_designation
WHERE code = 'SENIOR';

-- Step 4: Create position
INSERT INTO popular_organization_position (
    id, title, code,
    department_id, team_id, designation_id,
    responsibilities, required_skills, experience_years
) VALUES (
    ?,
    'Senior Backend Developer',
    'ENG-BACKEND-SENIOR-DEV',
    ?, ?, ?,
    'Design APIs, mentor juniors, code reviews',
    'PHP, MySQL, Redis, Docker',
    5
);
```

## Data Integrity Rules

1. **Unique Codes:**
   - Department codes, team codes, designation codes must be unique
   - Position codes should be unique (pattern: DEPT-TEAM-DESIGNATION)

2. **Active Status:**
   - Inactive positions cannot be assigned to new vacancies
   - Existing contracts remain valid even if position becomes inactive

3. **Team Optional:**
   - Positions can exist without a team (department-level positions)
   - Example: "HR Manager" (no specific team)

4. **Hierarchical Consistency:**
   - If position has a team, the team must belong to the same department
