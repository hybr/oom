## Position Resolution Chain

This is critical for the Process Flow System:

```
EMPLOYMENT_CONTRACT
  ↓ (via job_offer_id)
JOB_OFFER
  ↓ (via application_id)
VACANCY_APPLICATION
  ↓ (via vacancy_id)
ORGANIZATION_VACANCY
  ↓ (via popular_position_id)
POPULAR_ORGANIZATION_POSITION
  ↓
Used by: PROCESS_NODE (task assignment)
```

**Example:**
```
John Smith is hired as "Senior Backend Developer"
  → EMPLOYMENT_CONTRACT (employee_id = John, position_id = Senior Backend Dev)
    → Tasks requiring "Senior Backend Developer with APPROVER permission"
      → Can be assigned to John Smith
```

## Common Queries

### Get Active Vacancies
```sql
SELECT
    v.*,
    o.short_name as organization,
    pos.title as position,
    p.first_name || ' ' || p.last_name as created_by_name
FROM organization_vacancy v
JOIN organization o ON v.organization_id = o.id
JOIN popular_organization_position pos ON v.popular_position_id = pos.id
JOIN person p ON v.created_by = p.id
WHERE v.status = 'OPEN'
AND v.deleted_at IS NULL
AND (v.closing_date IS NULL OR v.closing_date > date('now'))
ORDER BY v.is_urgent DESC, v.opening_date DESC;
```

### Get Application Pipeline for Vacancy
```sql
SELECT
    va.id,
    p.first_name || ' ' || p.last_name as applicant_name,
    va.application_date,
    va.status,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ai.id) as interview_count,
    AVG(ai.rating) as avg_interview_rating,
    jo.status as offer_status
FROM vacancy_application va
JOIN person p ON va.applicant_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN application_interview ai ON ai.application_id = va.id
LEFT JOIN job_offer jo ON jo.application_id = va.id
WHERE va.vacancy_id = ?
AND va.deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY va.id
ORDER BY va.application_date DESC;
```

### Get Interview Schedule for Applicant
```sql
SELECT
    ai.*,
    ist.name as stage_name,
    ist.order_number,
    interviewer.first_name || ' ' || interviewer.last_name as interviewer_name,
    v.title as vacancy_title
FROM application_interview ai
JOIN interview_stage ist ON ai.stage_id = ist.id
JOIN person interviewer ON ai.interviewer_id = interviewer.id
JOIN vacancy_application va ON ai.application_id = va.id
JOIN organization_vacancy v ON va.vacancy_id = v.id
WHERE va.applicant_id = ?
AND ai.status IN ('SCHEDULED', 'COMPLETED')
ORDER BY ist.order_number, ai.scheduled_date;
```

### Get Active Employees by Position
```sql
SELECT
    ec.*,
    p.first_name || ' ' || p.last_name as employee_name,
    pos.title as position_title,
    o.short_name as organization
FROM employment_contract ec
JOIN person p ON ec.employee_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN popular_organization_position pos ON ec.position_id = pos.id
JOIN organization o ON ec.organization_id = o.id
WHERE ec.status = 'ACTIVE'
AND ec.deleted_at IS NULL
AND ec.position_id = ?
ORDER BY ec.start_date;
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Vacancy Status Flow
```
DRAFT (being created)
  ↓
PENDING (submitted for approval)
  ↓
APPROVED (approved by management)
  ↓
OPEN (published, accepting applications)
  ↓
CLOSED (no longer accepting applications)
```

### Pattern: Application Status Flow
```
SUBMITTED (initial application)
  ↓
UNDER_REVIEW (being screened)
  ↓
SHORTLISTED (passed initial review)
  ↓
{REJECTED, WITHDRAWN} (end states)
```

### Pattern: Multiple Interviews
```
APPLICATION_INTERVIEW (Phone Screening, order_number=1)
  ↓ recommendation = HIRE
APPLICATION_INTERVIEW (Technical, order_number=2)
  ↓ recommendation = HIRE
APPLICATION_INTERVIEW (Final, order_number=3)
  ↓ recommendation = HIRE
JOB_OFFER created
```

## Data Integrity Rules

1. **Vacancy Must Have Position:**
   - Every vacancy MUST reference a `popular_position_id`
   - Position determines department, team, and designation

2. **Application Uniqueness:**
   - A person cannot apply to the same vacancy twice
   - Constraint: UNIQUE(vacancy_id, applicant_id)

3. **Offer Acceptance:**
   - Only ACCEPTED offers create employment contracts
   - One offer per application

4. **Employment Contract:**
   - Can exist without job_offer_id (e.g., existing employees)
   - Must have organization_id and employee_id

5. **Interview Ordering:**
   - Interview stages should be completed in order
   - Use `interview_stage.order_number` to enforce sequence
