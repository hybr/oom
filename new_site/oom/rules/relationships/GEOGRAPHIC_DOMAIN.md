## Relationship Details

### COUNTRY ‚Üí STATE
- **Type:** One-to-Many
- **Constraint:** A state must belong to exactly one country
- **Cascade:** Updates cascaded, deletes restricted

### STATE ‚Üí CITY
- **Type:** One-to-Many
- **Constraint:** A city must belong to exactly one state
- **Cascade:** Updates cascaded, deletes restricted

### CITY/STATE ‚Üí POSTAL_ADDRESS
- **Type:** One-to-Many (both)
- **Constraint:** Address must reference both city AND state
- **Purpose:** Redundancy for faster queries and data integrity

### POSTAL_ADDRESS ‚Üí PERSON/ORGANIZATION
- **Type:** Many-to-One (Optional)
- **Constraint:** Must link to EITHER person_id OR organization_id (not both, not neither)
- **Rule:** At least one foreign key must be set

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Multiple Addresses per Person
A person can have multiple addresses with different types:
```
PERSON (John Smith)
  ‚îú‚îÄ POSTAL_ADDRESS (HOME, is_primary=1)
  ‚îú‚îÄ POSTAL_ADDRESS (WORK, is_primary=0)
  ‚îî‚îÄ POSTAL_ADDRESS (BILLING, is_primary=0)
```

### Pattern 2: Primary Address
Each person/organization should have exactly one primary address:
```sql
-- Constraint (application-level)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM postal_address
WHERE person_id = ?
AND is_primary = 1
AND deleted_at IS NULL;
-- Should return 1
```

### Pattern 3: Geographic Hierarchy Query
Getting full address with hierarchy:
```sql
SELECT
    pa.first_street,
    pa.area,
    pa.postal_code,
    c.name as city_name,
    s.name as state_name,
    co.name as country_name
FROM postal_address pa
JOIN city c ON pa.city_id = c.id
JOIN state s ON pa.state_id = s.id
JOIN country co ON s.country_id = co.id
WHERE pa.id = ?;
```

---

## Address Types

Common values for `address_type`:
- `HOME` - Residential address
- `WORK` - Office/workplace
- `BILLING` - Billing address
- `SHIPPING` - Delivery address
- `MAILING` - Correspondence address
- `TEMPORARY` - Temporary location

---

## Geocoding Support

POSTAL_ADDRESS includes optional geocoding fields:
```
latitude?  - Geographic latitude (-90 to 90)
longitude? - Geographic longitude (-180 to 180)
```

**Usage:**
- Map visualization
- Distance calculations
- Location-based services
- Delivery routing

---

## Common Queries

### Get Address with Full Hierarchy
```sql
SELECT
    pa.*,
    c.name as city,
    s.name as state,
    s.state_code,
    co.name as country,
    co.iso_code as country_code
FROM postal_address pa
JOIN city c ON pa.city_id = c.id
JOIN state s ON pa.state_id = s.id
JOIN country co ON s.country_id = co.id
WHERE pa.id = ?
AND pa.deleted_at IS NULL;
```

### Get Primary Address for Person
```sql
SELECT * FROM postal_address
WHERE person_id = ?
AND is_primary = 1
AND deleted_at IS NULL
LIMIT 1;
```

### Find Addresses by City
```sql
SELECT pa.*, p.first_name, p.last_name
FROM postal_address pa
LEFT JOIN person p ON pa.person_id = p.id
WHERE pa.city_id = ?
AND pa.deleted_at IS NULL;
```

### Get Cities in State
```sql
SELECT * FROM city
WHERE state_id = ?
AND is_active = 1
AND deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY name;
```

## Data Integrity Rules

1. **State-City Consistency:**
   - A city's state_id must match the address's state_id
   - Enforced at application level

2. **Exclusive Ownership:**
   - Address must belong to EITHER person OR organization
   - Validation: `(person_id IS NOT NULL AND organization_id IS NULL) OR (person_id IS NULL AND organization_id IS NOT NULL)`

3. **Primary Address:**
   - Only one primary address per person/organization
   - Enforced at application level

4. **Soft Deletes:**
   - Geographic entities use soft deletes
   - Inactive cities/states marked with `is_active = 0`
