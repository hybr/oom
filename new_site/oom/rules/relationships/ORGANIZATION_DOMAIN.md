## Three-Tier Membership Model

A person can relate to an organization in three ways:

### Tier 1: Main Admin (Owner)
```sql
-- Via organization.main_admin_id
SELECT * FROM organization
WHERE main_admin_id = ?;
```
- **Permissions:** Full ownership
- **Count:** Exactly 1 per organization
- **Transferable:** Yes (by current main_admin or super_admin)

### Tier 2: Organization Admin
```sql
-- Via organization_admin table
SELECT * FROM organization_admin
WHERE person_id = ?
AND is_active = 1;
```
- **Permissions:** Role-based (SUPER_ADMIN, ADMIN, MODERATOR)
- **Count:** 0 to many per organization
- **Revocable:** Yes (by main_admin or super_admin)

### Tier 3: Employee
```sql
-- Via employment_contract
SELECT * FROM employment_contract
WHERE employee_id = ?
AND status = 'ACTIVE';
```
- **Permissions:** Position-based only
- **Count:** 0 to many per organization
- **Managed by:** Admins with appropriate permissions

**A person can hold multiple tiers simultaneously!**

## Common Queries

### Get Organization with All Admins
```sql
-- Organization details
SELECT * FROM organization WHERE id = ?;

-- Main admin
SELECT p.* FROM person p
JOIN organization o ON o.main_admin_id = p.id
WHERE o.id = ?;

-- All admins
SELECT p.*, oa.role, oa.appointed_at
FROM organization_admin oa
JOIN person p ON oa.person_id = p.id
WHERE oa.organization_id = ?
AND oa.is_active = 1
ORDER BY
  CASE oa.role
    WHEN 'SUPER_ADMIN' THEN 1
    WHEN 'ADMIN' THEN 2
    WHEN 'MODERATOR' THEN 3
  END;
```

### Get Complete Infrastructure
```sql
SELECT
    b.name as branch_name,
    bld.name as building_name,
    w.workstation_code,
    w.floor_number,
    w.workstation_type
FROM organization o
LEFT JOIN organization_branch b ON b.organization_id = o.id
LEFT JOIN organization_building bld ON bld.organization_id = o.id
LEFT JOIN workstation w ON w.organization_building_id = bld.id
WHERE o.id = ?
ORDER BY b.name, bld.name, w.floor_number, w.workstation_code;
```

### Check User Permission Level
```sql
-- Check if user is main admin
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM organization
WHERE id = ? AND main_admin_id = ?;

-- Check admin role
SELECT role FROM organization_admin
WHERE organization_id = ? AND person_id = ?
AND is_active = 1;

-- Check if employee
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employment_contract
WHERE organization_id = ? AND employee_id = ?
AND status = 'ACTIVE';
```

## Data Integrity Rules

1. **Main Admin Requirement:**
   - Every organization MUST have a main_admin_id
   - Main admin cannot be removed (must be transferred first)

2. **Admin Appointment:**
   - Only main_admin or super_admin can appoint other admins
   - Track appointer via appointed_by field

3. **Infrastructure Hierarchy:**
   - Workstations MUST belong to a building
   - Buildings CAN exist without a branch
   - Branches MUST belong to an organization

4. **Soft Deletes:**
   - All organization entities use soft deletes
   - Check `deleted_at IS NULL` in all queries

5. **Organization Isolation:**
   - Enforce organization_id in all multi-tenant queries
   - Prevent cross-organization data access
